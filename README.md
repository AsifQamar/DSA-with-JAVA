Welcome! This repository is my personal journey through the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in Java. It serves as a practice log and a collection of clean, well-explained solutions to common DSA problems.

The problems and learning path are inspired by some of the best resources available:
* **Kunal Kushwaha's DSA Bootcamp**
* **AlgoCamp DSA Program**
* **My Curated DSA Questions**

## üìö Topics Covered

The repository is organized by topic, covering a wide range of essential DSA concepts.

### Data Structures
* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
* Stacks & Queues
* Heaps & Priority Queues
* Trees (Binary, BST, AVL)
* Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees
* Graphs
* Tries
* Hash Maps & Sets

### Algorithms
* Sorting & Searching
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Divide & Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Bit Manipulation
* Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
* String Algorithms (KMP, Z-algorithm)
