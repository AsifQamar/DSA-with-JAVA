Welcome! This repository is my personal journey through the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in Java. It serves as a practice log and a collection of clean, well-explained solutions to common DSA problems.

The problems and learning path are inspired by some of the best resources available:
* **Kunal Kushwaha's DSA Bootcamp**
* **AlgoCamp DSA Program**
* **My Curated DSA Questions**
